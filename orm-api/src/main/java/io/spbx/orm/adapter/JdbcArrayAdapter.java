/**
 * Represents an adapter that can convert the entity from an array and back for JDBC communication.
 * The array must contain only JDBC acceptable types, otherwise the JDBC {@link java.sql.Connection}
 * won't understand them.
 * <p>
 * The adapter should be annotated by {@link JdbcAdapt} and by convention called {@code %Type%JdbcAdapter},
 * so that the system could identify it in the classpath and assign to corresponding values automatically.
 * This is recommended though optional, because the adapter can be assigned manually to a field using
 * {@link io.spbx.orm.api.annotate.Sql} or {@link io.spbx.orm.api.annotate.Sql.Via} annotation.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the methods below, the adapter is expected to implement a creation method with a signature:
 * {@snippet lang = "java":
 *     public E createInstance(T1 value1, T2 value2, ..., Tn value_n);
 * }
 * Where {@code T1}, {@code T2}, etc. are all JDBC values necessary for the entity. The number of values
 * must match the length of an array from {@link #toNewValuesArray(Object)}.
 * <p>
 * Finally, the adapter is expected to expose a public static final instance, usually called {@code ADAPTER}.
 * It's not mandatory, but recommended for efficiency reasons.
 *
 * @param <E> the entity type
